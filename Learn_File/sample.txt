Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum
Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC
1 language (itself inspired by SETL), capable of exception handling and
interfacing with the Amoeba operating 10 system. Its implementation began in
December 1989.
